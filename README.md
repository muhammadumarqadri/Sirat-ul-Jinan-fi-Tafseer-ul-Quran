## 🧩 How It Works

- `script.js` dynamically creates cards for each volume
- Each card has two buttons:
  - **📖 Read** → Opens the PDF in a new browser tab
  - **⬇️ Download** → Downloads the PDF using the `download` attribute
- All links use Dropbox’s direct-access `?raw=1` URLs

## 📦 Example PDF Link (Dropbox)

```plaintext
https://www.dropbox.com/s/abc123xyz/sirat-ul-jinan-jild-1.pdf?raw=1

This link structure allows the file to be viewed directly in the browser **and** downloaded when needed.
